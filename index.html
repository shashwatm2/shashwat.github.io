       <p>
        Our project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 variants by creating an interactive JBrowse2 platform that allows users to explore genomic data, including mutations, conserved regions, and structural differences between key variants of interest (VOIs). Using multiple sequence alignment (MSA), we compared the nucleotide sequences of variants like Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, identifying shared and unique mutations that could influence viral evolution, immune escape, and transmissibility. We also incorporated Protein Data Bank (PDB) files of the spike proteins for each variant, enabling further investigation into structural variations, particularly how they interface with the ACE2 receptor. Our platform aims to facilitate future research on viral evolution and inform the design of more effective vaccines.
